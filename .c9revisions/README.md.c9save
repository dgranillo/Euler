Multiples of 3 and 5\n  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we\n  get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the\n  multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.\n\n2.  Even Fibonacci numbers\n  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous\n  two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:\n  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed\n  four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.\n  \n3.  Largest prime factor\n  The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime\n  factor of the number 600851475143 ?\n\n4.  Largest palindrome product\n  A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made\n  from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest\n  palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.\n\n5.  Smallest multiple\n  2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from\n  1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is\n  evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?\n\n6.  Sum square difference\t\n  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,\n  12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385\n  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,\n  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025\n  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural\n  numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640. Find the difference\n  between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and\n  the square of the sum.\n\n7.  10001st prime\n  By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see\n  that the 6th prime is 13.

Longest Collatz sequence\n  The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:\n  n → n/2 (n is even)\n  n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)\n  Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:\n  13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1. It can be seen that this sequence\n  (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not\n  been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers\n  finish at 1.\n  Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?\n  NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.\n\n15. [Lattice paths](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)\n16. Power digit sum\n  2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26. What is the\n  sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?\n\n17. Number letter counts\n  If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,\n  then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the\n  numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how\n  many letters would be used?\n  NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and\n  forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20\n  letters. The use of \"and\" when writing out numbers is in compliance with\n  British usage.\n\n18. Maximum path sum I\n  By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on\n  the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.\n     3\n    7 4\n   2 4 6\n  8 5 9 3\n  That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the\n  triangle below:\n                  75\n                 95 64\n               17 47 82\n              18 35 87 10\n             20 04 82 47 65\n            19 01 23 75 03 34\n           88 02 77 73 07 63 67\n          99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92\n         41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33\n       41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29\n      53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14\n     70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57\n    91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48\n   63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31\n  04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23\n  NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by\n  trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle\n  containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires\n  a clever method! ;o)\n\n19. Counting Sundays\n  You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some\n  research for yourself. \n  1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.\n  Thirty days has September,\n  April, June and November.\n  All the rest have thirty-one,\n  Saving February alone,\n  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.\n  And on leap years, twenty-nine.\n  A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century\n  unless it is divisible by 400. How many Sundays fell on the first of the month\n  during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?\n\n20. Factorial digit sum\n  n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1. For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3\n  × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + \n  8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
